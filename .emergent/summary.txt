**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Implementing user requests from message #275. Specifically, the agent was adding **Course Level and Location filters** to the counselor-facing Explore Courses page (). It had updated the state and data fetching logic and was in the middle of adding the UI components for the new filters.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? both
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** Complete UI for Level and Location filters on the Explore Courses page.
-   **Issue 2 (P1):** Rework the By Location tab in the Admin College Management page.
-   **Issue 3 (P1):** Create a UI for admins to add/update Admission Alerts.

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1: Complete UI for Explore Courses filters**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started adding state management and UI components for 'level' and 'location' filters in . The work is incomplete.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Open .
        2.  Finish implementing the JSX for the  components for Level and Location filters, similar to the existing Category filter.
        3.  Ensure the  logic correctly applies the new filters.
        4.  Test the page to confirm all filters (Search, Category, Level, Location) work together.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill a direct user request and make the Courses page more useful for counselors.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

-   **Issue 2: Rework By Location tab in Admin College Management**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a new request.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Open .
        2.  Modify the logic for the By Location tab to group colleges by **City** instead of State.
        3.  Add a new tab titled By State that groups colleges by State.
        4.  Verify that both tabs display the correct grouping and statistics.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To correct the functionality as per the user's request and provide more granular location-based insights for admins.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

-   **Issue 3: Create UI for Managing Admission Alerts**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a new request. The backend endpoint  exists, but there is no UI to call it.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Decide on the best location for this UI (e.g., a new Alerts tab in College Management or a button on each college card).
        2.  Create a new component (e.g., ) that allows an admin to view, add, edit, and delete alerts for a specific college.
        3.  The dialog should have form fields for , ,  (Info, Warning, etc.), , and .
        4.  Integrate this component into the chosen admin page and connect it to the backend endpoint.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The user explicitly asked how to update alerts, and currently, it's impossible without direct database access. This will complete the admission alerts feature.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Add Level and Location filters to Courses page.**
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue editing  to add the filter UI components. The agent was editing lines 238-280.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A more powerful filtering system for counselors on the Explore Courses page.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

-   **Architecture:** Decoupled frontend/backend monorepo with a REST API.

**key DB schema**
-   **colleges:** added 
-   **courses:** added , , , , 
-   **placements:** (new collection) 

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Heavily modified to add new models, endpoints, and seed data for alerts, seat status, placements, and detailed course info.
-   : New page for counselors to browse courses. Currently being modified to add more filters.
-   : New admin page to manage colleges and course seat status. Needs tab rework.

-   , : Updated with new navigation links.
-   : Updated with completed features.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The backend  file has grown substantially and contains all models, routes, and business logic. It should be split into a more modular structure (e.g., , , ).

**key api endpoints**

-   : Update course seat availability.
-   : Update admission alerts for a college.
-   : Get a list of all courses with extended details.
-   : Get placement data for a college.
-   : Get courses that need seat status updates.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Any changes to data models in  require dropping the database ({ ok: 1, dropped: 'test_database' }) and re-running the seed endpoint () to apply changes and populate data.
