Key points: 1) Dashboard college cards redesigned without images - now use GraduationCap icon with gradient background, show Featured badge, Category, Established year, and Accreditation. 2) Scholarship Summary Report API at /api/admin/scholarship-summary supports view_by=month and view_by=college parameters. Frontend shows stats cards, breakdown table, and recent recipients. 3) Target Alerts API at /api/admin/target-alerts shows counselors behind on targets. Currently shows 'All counselors are on track!' since no targets are set. 4) Fixed a bug where scholarship breakdown wasn't refreshing when switching views - added useEffect to re-fetch data when scholarshipViewBy changes.",
