The bug where courses were empty in the dialog has been fixed - courses are now fetched via API call to /api/colleges/{college_id}/courses instead of filtering from limited local cache.",

  "context_for_next_testing_agent": "Iteration 14 tested the bug fix for 'Manage Courses' dialog on /admin/colleges page. The bug was that courses were being filtered from a limited local cache of 100 courses instead of making a fresh API call. The fix added new state variables `selectedCollegeCourses` and `loadingCollegeCourses`, and modified `handleManageCourses` to fetch courses from `/api/colleges/{college_id}/courses` API endpoint when dialog opens. All features verified working: dialog opens with correct courses, table shows Course Name/Duration/Level/Seat Status, seat status dropdown works with all 4 options (Available, Closing, Under Waiting, Closed), and status changes are persisted and reflected in UI.",
